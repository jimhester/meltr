The goal of 'meltr' is to provide a fast and friendly way to read
non-rectangular data (like ragged forms of 'csv', 'tsv', and 'fwf').

Standard tools like readr::read_csv() can cope to some extent with unusual inputs, like files with empty rows or newlines embedded in strings.
But some files are so wacky that standard tools don't work at all, and instead you have to take the file to pieces and reassemble it in a standard design.

The meltr package separates delimited text files into individual cells.

## Installation

You can install the released version of meltr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("meltr")
```

## The problem with non-rectangular data

Here's a contrived example that breaks two assumptions made by common tools like `readr::read_csv()`.

1. There are more cells in some rows than others.
2. There are mixed data types within each column.

The `melt_csv()` function reads the file one cell at a time, importing each cell of the file into a whole row of the final data frame.

```{r}
writeLines("Help,,007,I'm
1960-09-30,FALSE,trapped in,7,1.21
non-rectangular,data,NA", "messy.csv")

library(meltr)

melt_csv("messy.csv")
```

What the `melt_csv()` output means:

- The output of `melt_csv()` is a data frame – structured data about un-structured data!
- Each row of the data frame represents one cell of the input data.
- The empty cell of row 1 is imported, but the missing cells at the ends of rows 1 and 3 aren't.
- No data type conversion is attempted – every value is imported as a string, and the `data_type` column merely gives meltr's best guess of what the data types ought to be.

How can you use this? To begin with, you can do some simple manipulations with ordinary functions.

For example you could extract the words.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

data <- melt_csv("messy.csv") %>%
  filter(data_type == "character")
```

Or find if there are missing entries.

```{r}
data %>%
  filter(data_type == "character")
```

```{r, show = FALSE}
unlink("messy.csv")
```
